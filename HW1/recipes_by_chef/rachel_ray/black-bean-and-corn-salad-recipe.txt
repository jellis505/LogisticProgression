2 cups frozen corn kernels, 2 teaspoons hot sauce, just eyeball the amount (recommended: Tabasco), 1 lime, juiced, Salt and pepper
 	 Combine all ingredients in a bowl. Let stand at least 15 minutes for corn to fully defrost and flavors to combine, then toss and serve. The corn will also place a quick-chill on this easy side-salad as it defrosts -- no need to refrigerate!
