James Gunn
CSSF Founding Director





    jgunn@ku.edu 


James Gunn in 2010.

James Gunn was born in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1923. He received his B.S. degree in 
journalism in 1947 after three years in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and his M.A. 
in English in 1951, both from the University of Kansas. He also did graduate work in theater 
at KU and Northwestern. In 1969 at the University of Kansas, he taught one of 
the first courses in science fiction.
In 2007, Gunn was named "Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master."
Read the story - and see lots of photos - here. 
He was Guest of Honor at the 2013
WorldCon in San 
Antonio, Texas; Special Guest at this year's
Eaton/SFRA Conference 
in Riverside, California; and of course permanent Special Guest at the Campbell Conference 
in Lawrence, Kansas.
Gunn has worked as an editor of paperback reprints, as managing editor of KU 
alumni publications, as director of KU public relations, as a professor of English, and now 
is professor emeritus of English and director of the Center for the Study of Science Fiction. 
He won national awards for his work as an editor and a director of public relations. He was awarded the Byron Caldwell Smith Award in recognition of literary achievement and the 
Edward Grier Award for excellence in teaching, was President of the
Science Fiction Writers of America for 1971-72 and 
President of the 
Science Fiction Research Association from 
1980-82, was guest of honor at many regional SF conventions, including SFeracon in 
Zagreb, Yugoslavia, and Polcon, the Polish National SF convention, in Katowice; was 
presented the Pilgrim Award of SFRA in 1976, a special award from the 1976 World 
SF Convention for Alternate Worlds, a Science Fiction Achievement Award 
(Hugo) by the 1983 World SF Convention for Isaac Asimov: The Foundations 
of Science Fiction, the Eaton Award in 1992 for lifetime achievement, and 
named Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master 
by the
Science Fiction Writers of America in 2007; was a 
KU Mellon Fellow in 1981 and 1984; and served from 1978-80 and 1985-present as 
chairman of the Campbell Award jury to select the best science-fiction novel of the year. He
has lectured in Denmark, China, Iceland, Japan, Poland, Romania, Singapore, Sweden, 
Taiwan, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union for the U.S. Information Agency.



Gunn started writing SF in 1948, was a full-time freelance writer for four years, and 
has had nearly 100 stories published in magazines and books; most of them have been 
reprinted, some as many as a dozen times. He is the author of 26 books and the editor of 18; 
his master's thesis was serialized in a pulp magazine. Four of his stories were dramatized 
over NBC radio's "X Minus One"; "The Cave of Night" was dramatized on television's Desilu 
Playhouse in 1959 as "Man in Orbit"; and The Immortals was dramatized as an 
ABC-TV "Movie of the Week" in 1969 as "The Immortal" and became an hour-long series in 
1970-71. His stories and books have been reprinted in Australia, China, England, France, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Scandinavia, 
South America, Spain, Taiwan, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia.
He is also a championship bridge player.

Go 
 here to read a tribute to James Gunn by former student, John Kessel, 
 presented at Gunn's Grand Master induction ceremony.

Gunn's publications are listed below. In early March, 2012, he sold 
	three more books, including his newest novel:

Transcendental, 
anticipated publication in August, 2013, by Tor Books.
Campbell Conference and
SF Writers Workshop attendees have heard excerpts 
from this wonderful new novel.
Co-authored with Jack Williamson in 1954 and originally published in 1955, Star Bridge will be published in Tor 
Books' classic reprint series. 
Together the two novels, almost 60 years apart, bookend a career and in some ways the space epic itself. Also to be reprinted:
Alternate Worlds: The Illustrated History of Science Fiction, 
to be published in China by the Beijing Division of the Shanghai Century Publishing Company. 
By a marvelous serendipity, the book was translated by Sasha Jiang, the Center's 
2011-2012 visiting scholar from China.



James Gunn's Birthday cake from 2004:
"The uninspected belief is not worth holding," Jim's take on the saying, "The uninspected life is not worth living."
