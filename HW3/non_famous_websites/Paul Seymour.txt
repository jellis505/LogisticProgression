Contact Info:

Email:  pds@math.princeton.edu
Office: 201 Fine Hall, Washington Rd, Princeton NJ 08544.
Phone:  (609) 258-4685

Affiliation:

Professor, half 
in the 
Department of Mathematics   
and half in the 

Program in Applied and Computational Math
at 
Princeton University.

Research:

Discrete math, mostly in graph theory; I am currently working on 
the structure of graphs with certain 
induced subgraphs forbidden, and analogous questions for
tournaments. In particular I am interested 
in the Erdos-Hajnal
conjecture, and in the various conjectures of Gyarfas and Sumner about
chi-boundedness.
The web pages of Maria Chudnovsky and 
Robin Thomas have more information
about our joint work.
