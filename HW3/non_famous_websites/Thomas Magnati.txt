Biography
Thomas L. Magnanti is an Institute Professor at MIT.  He has previously served as Dean of Engineering, Head of the Management Science Area of the MIT Sloan School, Co-Director of the interdepartmental Operations Research Center, and as founding Co-Director of the Leaders for Manufacturing and System Design and Management Programs.  He currently is the Founding Director of the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART).  He was previously president of three professional societies as well as editor of the journal Operations Research.
Professor Magnanti has devoted much of his professional career to education that combines engineering and management and to teaching and research in applied and theoretical aspects of large-scale optimization.  He has conducted research on optimization theory and on such topics as production planning and scheduling, transportation planning, facility location, logistics, and communication systems design.  His publications include co-authorship of two textbooks, Applied Mathematical Programming and Network Flows: Theory, Algorithms and Applications, and the co-editorship of two other books.
