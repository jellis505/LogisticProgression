Background
Dimitris Anastassiou is Charles Batchelor Professor and Director of Columbia University's Genomic Information Systems Laboratory, member of Columbia's Initiative in Systems Biology and of the Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). He is doing research on computational biology with emphasis on data mining and systems-based analysis of large biomolecular data sets. 

Professor Anastassiou joined the E.E. faculty in 1983. From 1979 until 1983 he was a Research Staff member at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY. He is an IEEE Fellow, the recipient of an IBM Outstanding Innovation Award, a National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award, and a Great Teacher Award from the Society of Columbia Graduates. His previous research was in the area of video technology. He is author of patents accepted as essential for the implementation of the international standards MPEG-2, AVC/H.264 and MVC used in DVDs including Blu-ray HDTV discs and digital television broadcasting.

His current research in systems biology is focused on the discovery and elucidation of "pan-cancer" biomolecular mechanisms shared by multiple cancer types and the associated potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic applications.
