                    Dr. Katepalli R. Sreenivasan
                






Katepalli R. Sreenivasan is senior vice provost for science/technology for the Global Network University, and provost for the Polytechnic Institute of New York University (NYU). He is also university professor, Department of Physics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU. Sreenivasan was previously director of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (Trieste, Italy), distinguished university professor and professor of physics and engineering at the University of Maryland, and director of the Institute for Physical Science and Technology. Sreenivasan is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering, and is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He plays a significant role in the planning and development of NYU as a Global Network University.
 
Sreenivasan earned his bachelor’s in mechanical engineering from Bangalore University, India, in 1968, and both his master’s and doctorate in aeronautical engineering from the Indian Institute of Science in 1970 and 1975, respectively.
 
He is an international leader on the nature of turbulent flows, including experiment, theory, and simulations; his expertise crosses the boundaries of physics, engineering, and mathematics. 
 
His honors include the Guggenheim Fellowship, the Otto Laporte Memorial Award of American Physical Society, the TWAS Medal Lecture in Engineering Science, the Distinguished Alumnus Award and the Centennial Professorship of the Indian Institute of Science, the Sir C.V. Raman Visiting Professorship of the Indian Academy of Sciences, the International Prize and Gold Medal in memory of Professors Modesto Panetti and Carlo Ferrari, the Academia delle Scienze di Torino, Italy, the National Order of Scientific Merit by the Brazilian Government and the Academy of Sciences, the UNESCO Medal for Promoting International Scientific Cooperation and World Peace from the World Heritage Centre, Florence, Italy, the President Dr. Zakir Husain Memorial Award from the Duty Society and the Indian Society of Applied and Industrial Mathematics, an honorary member, Academia Torre e Tasso, Duino-Aurisina, Trieste, Italy, the Melvin Jones Fellow of the Lions Club (for humanitarian service), the Dwight Nicholson Medal of the American Physical Society for human outreach, and the 2009 Nusselt-Reynolds Prize from the Assembly of World Conference on Experimental Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics, and Thermodynamics. Sreenivasan has delivered a number of named lectures, is a fellow of several learned societies, and the recipient of three honorary doctorates.
 
Sreenivasan is the author of more than 240 research papers and has served the scientific community in several capacities, in both official and scholarly capacities. He has been instrumental in creating new entities such as the Topical Group in Statistical and Nonlinear Physics of the American Physical Society. He is interested in human rights, especially as they apply to scientists, and presently holds a unique position with respect to international science and science policy, especially in developing countries.
 
Sreenivasan will collaborate with Diego Donzis, assistant professor of aerospace engineering; Devesh Ranjan, assistant professor of mechanical engineering; and Adonios Karpetis, associate professor of aerospace engineering, in the Dwight Look College Engineering as well as several faculty members from the College of Science.
