I am one of
the two editors in chief
for a new ACL-sponsored journal,

Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics
(TACL). Please consider submitting a paper!



Current teaching (Fall
  2013): 
COMS W4705, Natural Language Processing.




Online teaching:
In Spring 2013 I taught an 

online course on Natural Language Processing
on 

Coursera.

Notes for the Coursera class are posted
here.

Bio: 
My research interests are in natural language processing,
and machine learning. I completed a PhD in computer science from the
University of Pennsylvania in December 1998. From January 1999 to
November 2002 I was a researcher at AT&T Labs-Research, and from
January 2003 until December 2010 I was an assistant/associate professor
at MIT. I joined Columbia University in January 2011.
