Dr. 
                      Widnall received her Sc.D. from MIT.
She 
                      has served as Associate Provost, MIT, and as Secretary of 
                      the Air Force. As Secretary of the Air Force, Dr. Widnall 
                      was responsible for all affairs of the Department of the 
                      Air Force including recruiting, organizing, training, administration, 
                      logistical support, maintenance, and welfare of personnel. 
                      During this time, the Air Force issued its long range vision 
                      statement: Global Engagement: A Vision for the 21st Century 
                      Air Force, which defined the path from the air and space 
                      force of today to the space and air force of the next century. 
                      Dr. Widnall was also responsible for research and development 
                      and other activities prescribed by the President or the 
                      Secretary of Defense. She co-chaired the Department of Defense 
                      Task Force on Sexual Harassment and Discrimination. She 
                      later stepped down to resume teaching.
Since 
                      returning to MIT, she has been active in the Lean Aerospace 
                      Initiative, with special emphasis on the space and policy 
                      focus teams. Her research activities in fluid dynamics have 
                      included the following: boundary layer stability, unsteady 
                      hydrodynamic loads on fully wetted and supercavitating hydrofoils 
                      of finite span, unsteady lifting-surface theory, unsteady 
                      air forces on oscillating cylinders in subsonic and supersonic 
                      flow, unsteady leading-edge vortex separation from slender 
                      delta wings, tip-vortex aerodynamics, helicopter noise, 
                      aerodynamics of high-speed ground transportation vehicles, 
                      vortex stability, aircraft-wake studies, turbulence, and 
                      transition. Her teaching activities have included undergraduate 
                      dynamics and aerodynamics, graduate level aerodynamics of 
                      wings and bodies, aeroelasticity, acoustics and aerodynamic 
                      noise, and aerospace vehicle vibration. She 
                      was a member of the Columbia accident investigation board 
                      and she was inducted into the Women's 
                      Hall of Fame in 2003.
