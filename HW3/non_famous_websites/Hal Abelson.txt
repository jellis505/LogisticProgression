MIT students interested in UROPs with me for fall 2013 should do this in
    conjunction with 6.S198.  You don't need to formally register for
    the course, but you should attend the meetings and the labs.  See
    the 6.S198 home page and fill out the
    Web form on that page, indicating that you are interested in a UROP.
