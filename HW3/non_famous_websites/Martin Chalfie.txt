We are using the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans
to investigate aspects of nerve cell development and function. The wealth
of developmental, anatomical, genetic, and molecular information available
for
C. elegans provides a powerful and multifaceted approach to
these studies. Our work has focused on the study of a set of six neurons
that are the sensory receptors for gentle touch (the touch cells), to address
two questions: 1) How is neuronal cell fate determined? and 2) What is
the molecular basis of mechanosensation, a sensory modality that underlies
a variety of senses(e.g., touch, hearing, and balance)? We also work on
neuronal degeneration, microtubule structure and function, channel structure
and function, and, most recently, synapse specification and aging. Facilitating
these studies is the development of new experimental methods, such as green
fluorescent protein as a gene and protein marker and a novel method to
generate subtractive cDNA libraries.
We initially approached touch cell development by mutational
analysis, obtaining more than 500 mutations (in 17 genes) that produce
a touch insensitive phenotype. These touch genes are needed for the generation,
specification, maintenance, and function of the cells. The first three
groups contain genes that regulate touch cell development, and the last
group (function) contains genes that are developmental targets of this
regulation. Many of the genes that regulate touch cell differentiation
are transcription factors. In addition we have identified seven other genes
that in combination with these genes specify the number and differentiation
of the touch cells. Twelve touch genes are needed for touch cell function.
The cloning and characterization of these genes have provided the first
molecular model for eukaryotic mechanosensation. In this model a channel
similar to the epithelial sodium channel in vertebrates is attached to
the extracellular matrix via an extracellular gating domain on the channel
and is attached intracellularly to a unique form of the microtubule. An
implication of this dual tethering is that the channel could be deformed
(and opened) by displacement of the microtubules by the touch stimulus.
We are currently testing the predictions of this model, biochemically and
electrophysiologically. In addition, we have recently developed methods
to quantify the forces needed to stimulate the touch cells, which we are
adapting to look for mutants that are supersensitive to touch.
The unc-4 gene encodes a homeodomain transcription
factor needed for the formation of specific interneuron synapses onto a
single class of C. elegans motor neurons. We have identified several genes
whose expression is reduced in unc-4 animals using a new subtractive library
method. Our working hypothesis is that these genes, several of which encode
membrane or secreted proteins, permit appropriate synapse formation, prevent
inappropriate synapse formation, or mature or maintain appropriate synapses
once they have formed.
The subtractive library method serendipitously allowed
us to identify a mutation in a C. elegans catalase gene. Unlike
previously known animal catalases, the product of this gene is not localized
to peroxisomes, but is found throughout the cytosol. We have shown that
this catalase is needed for the increase in adult life-span seen in several
C. elegans mutants, suggesting that oxidative damage is an important
factor in organismal aging. We are currently searching for other mutants
that affect life-span in C. elegans.
