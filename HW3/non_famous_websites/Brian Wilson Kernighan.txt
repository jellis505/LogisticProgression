D is for Digital: What a well-informed person should know about
computers and communications is now available at
 CreateSpace,
a division of Amazon.  This book is based on COS 109, Computers in Our
World.  It explains how today's computing and communications world
operates, from hardware through software to the Internet and the web.
It includes enough detail that you can understand how these systems
work, no matter what the reader's technical background.  The social,
political and legal issues that new technology creates are discussed as
well, so one can understand the difficult issues we face and appreciate
the tradeoffs that have to be made to resolve them.

It's intended as a compact but detailed and thorough explanation of how
computers and communications systems work, for non-technical readers who
want to better understand the world they live in.  It should be a useful
source for technical readers who want something that will help their
friends and family learn about digital systems.  $14.95.

 The 
 Kindle edition
is also available: $9.95.  Readable on any device that supports Amazon's Kindle
reader app.
 A Japanese translation is also available (March 2013).
 A Chinese translation is also available (July 2013).
