Immigration-Focused Curriculum Vitae
Jagdish Bhagwati is University Professor, Economics and Law, at Columbia University and Senior Fellow in International Economics at the Council on Foreign Relations. Although he is regarded as one of the foremost international trade economists of his generation, Professor Bhagwati has made many significant contributions to the field of migration and immigration policy over the last three decades, extending his scholarly research and public policy writings to virtually all questions raised by international migration. He has notably used insights from economics, ethics and politics in addressing these issues.
Professor Bhagwati has pioneered the analysis of the growing phenomenon of international personal mobility and the problems it creates for the design of a country's tax system. Professor Bhagwati's proposal to extend the source-country income tax to skilled migrants abroad gained significant scholarly, media and public-policy attention in the 1970's. The proposal was endorsed by the Nobel Laureate Jan Tinbergen, discussed at UNCTAD and was the central subject of a profile of Professor Bhagwati in The Guardian (UK).This issue is taken up extensively in several of his books: two on Taxing the Brain Drain , North Holland, 1976 International Factor Mobility , MIT Press (1983) and International Migration and Income Taxation , MIT Press (1991), jointly edited with John Wilson. This so-called "Bhagwati Tax" proposal has been revived in recent years and is currently being discussed by scholars, NGO's and policymakers.
Professor Bhagwati also edited two symposia on this and related immigration questions in the Journal of Public Economics as well as the Journal of Developmental Economics in the late 1970's.
Among his works on public policy, which have been published recently by MIT press in two successive volumes, are: A Stream of Windows: Unsettling Reflections on Trade, Immigration, and Democracy (1998), and The Wind of the Hundred Days, How Washington Mismanaged Globalization (2000). Both books have contributions to the subject matter of immigration, including challenges.
Professor Bhagwati has also written frequently for The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , The Financial Times, Foreign Affairs and The New Republic on immigration issues . A recent piece discussing the current administration's management of immigration policies is: Bush trades his principles, Financial Times, April 2002.
His latest article on immigration was published in the Jan/Feb 2003 Davos Issue of Foreign Affairs, titled Borders Beyond Control. Professor Bhagwati highlights the need for a shift of immigration policy away from attempts at curbing migration to coping with it.
Professor Bhagwati is currently Director of the Program on International Migration: Economics, Ethics and Law at the Columbia University Law School, and is engaged in several books and projects on the subject of international migration also at the Council on Foreign Relations.
