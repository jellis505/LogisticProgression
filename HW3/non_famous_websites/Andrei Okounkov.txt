 I moved to the Department of Mathematics of Princeton University. 
My new home page may be found 
here. 
I am interested in representation theory (of combinatorial
flavor) and its applications to algebraic geometry, mathematical physics,
probability, special functions, and other fields.
Here you can find  my  family
tree.
Most of my preprints can be found
on the Los Alamos preprint server.
















Some mathematical links that I find useful are:


 Search Mathematics
archives at Los Alamos

 Today's
postings on Los Alamos archive

 MathSciNet

 Penn
State's list of Mathematics Information servers

 UC Berkeley
Astronomy/Mathematics/Statistics Library

 Sloane's
On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences

More mathematical links can be found on the UCB Mathematics
home
page .
(In case you are wondering about the meaning of the background
pictures, those are zeros of
some bivariate Jacobi polynomials of degree 26.)
